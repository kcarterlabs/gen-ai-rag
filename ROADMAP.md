# ROADMAP.md – 30-Day GenAI Developer Pro Plan

---

## Week 1 – Foundations

- Understand LLM basics
- Understand embeddings + vector similarity
- Build basic chunker
- Implement S3 vector storage
- Implement cosine similarity search
- Call Bedrock embedding model
- Call Bedrock LLM model

Deliverable:
✔ Working RAG prototype

---

## Week 2 – Production Hardening

- Add cost tracking (DynamoDB)
- Add token budgeting
- Add top_k control
- Add metadata tagging
- Add multi-tenant isolation
- Improve chunking (sentence-aware)

Deliverable:
✔ Multi-tenant serverless RAG with cost logging

---

## Week 3 – Optimization & Evaluation

- Implement evaluation dataset
- Measure Precision@k
- Measure Recall@k
- Add retrieval re-ranking
- Add adaptive chunk sizing
- Add context compression

Deliverable:
✔ Measurable retrieval accuracy

---

## Week 4 – Advanced Topics (Exam Focus)

- Guardrails
- Prompt injection protection
- Hybrid search (keyword + vector)
- Streaming responses
- IAM least-privilege policies
- Cost optimization strategies

Deliverable:
✔ Production-ready architecture
✔ Exam-level architectural reasoning

---

## Ongoing Practice

- Whiteboard the architecture
- Practice cost estimation scenarios
- Practice explaining trade-offs:
  - S3 vs OpenSearch
  - Chunk size vs recall
  - Latency vs accuracy
  - Cost vs quality
